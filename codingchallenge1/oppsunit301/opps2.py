# Objectives
# Create if statements using these logical conditionals below. Each statement should print information to the screen depending on if the condition is met.

# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b
# Create an if statement using a logical conditional of your choice and include elif keyword that executes when other conditions met or and else when no condition is met.


# Example variables
a = 10
b = 20

# Check conditions using if, elif, and else
if a == b:
    print("a is equal to b")
elif a != b:
    print("a is not equal to b")
    
if a < b:
    print("a is less than b")
elif a <= b:
    print("a is less than or equal to b")
else:
    print("a is greater than b")

if a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")
elif a >= b:
    print("a is greater than or equal to b")
else:
    print("a is less than or equal to b")
