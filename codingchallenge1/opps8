#Lets create a script that would work like a DDOS attack by using a while loop
#In this script we want to contiune to ping our personal pc in a infitine while loop
#Somebody that had a control of a bot net could set up this script on thousands of computer and ping sites till they are overloaded and crash
# To End the loop try pressing control z or control c

#!/bin/bash
# Continuous ping script for educational purposes

#!/bin/bash
# Ping script with until loop to execute a specific number of times

# Define the target IP address
target="127.0.0.1"  # Localhost address (use your own IP address if needed)
count=10  # Number of pings to execute

# Loop until the count is zero
until [ $count -le 0 ]; do
    ping -c 1 $target
    ((count--))  # Decrease count by 1
